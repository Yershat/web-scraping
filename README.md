# web-scraping
The goal is to scrape 1000 phone numbers from the website: olx.kz/rabota. 
olx.kz/rabota is website where blue collar jobs postings are posted in Kazakhstan. 
New player is coming to the market. Indriver's daughter company InJob.
Company is aiming for Olx customers. 
They might need a data such as phone number for marketing. 
The objective is to create an app that will deliver up to 1000 scraped numbers from different job sectors. 

The objective not completed because I could not bypass Google protocol. However it worked okay in the beginning.
